# SparkTempBot
Take Temp Reading from Sensor and send alerts to Spark if over threshold

Notes:

Spark API room and Bot Access:

The spark script requires the user to obtain a Sparkbot secret and room ID using the Spark API. 
The simplest way to do this is to use Spark API apps already on https://developer.ciscospark.com. 
Both your Bot Secret and the Room idea are avialable here. You may have to generate a new Bot Secret,
should you lose the orginal.
